MESA (Mapping Environmentally Sensitive Assets) is a method and tool for turning spatial asset information into sensitivity maps and summaries that support planning, planning review, decision-making and emergency response preparations. This report gathers the key results in one place so you can quickly understand what the analysis indicates for the selected study areas.

The pages that follow provide a consistent “wrap” around the analysis: maps to show where patterns occur, charts and tables to summarise what was found, and a small set of visuals to help compare areas side-by-side. The intention is to make the findings readable without requiring specialist knowledge of the underlying processing.

Sensitivity in this report should be understood as a decision-support signal: it highlights where important assets may be more affected by a given pressure or scenario, and where extra attention, mitigation, or follow-up work may be needed. It is not a replacement for detailed field knowledge or a full impact assessment.

Use the report to orient yourself first (what areas are included, what the overall pattern looks like), then focus on the pages that match your question—whether you are screening options, comparing alternatives, or communicating priorities to others.

Because this report is generated from the same project results each time, it also provides a clear record of what was included in the analysis at the time it was produced. If you later update inputs, parameters, or scope, generating a new report is the recommended way to capture and share the updated picture.
