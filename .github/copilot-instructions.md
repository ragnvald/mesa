# Copilot repo instructions

Before making any code changes, running commands, staging files, or proposing decisions:

1. Open and read `instructions.md` in the repository root.
2. Follow it as the source of truth for repo conventions.

If `instructions.md` conflicts with other guidance, follow `instructions.md`.
