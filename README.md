# README for MESA Tool

## Overview
The MESA (Methods for Environmental Sensitivity Assessment) tool is an application designed to assess and map environmental sensitivity, particularly in relation to potential marine pollution incidents in the petroleum industry. It provides a systematic framework for evaluating the vulnerability and sensitivity of environmental assets such as coastal areas, ecosystems, and wildlife to pollution impacts. It is also well suited gor aggregate analysis as part of land use management plsnning processes.

The code has been compiled to an executable file (mesa.exe) which runs nicely on a Windows computer. The compiled files are big and in total they are at the last compilation 1.7 GB for Windows 11 and 0,7 Gb for Windows 10.

## Highlights
* Environmental Sensitivity Assessment: Systematic evaluation of various environmental assets' vulnerability to pollution.
* Mapping Capability: Visual representation of sensitivity assessments for easier interpretation and decision-making.
* User-Friendly GUI: Developed using Tkinter for easy navigation and usability.
* Compiled Executable: Distributable .exe version for convenient deployment and usage.
* Customizable Framework: Allows adaptation to different environmental contexts and sensitivity parameters.

## Getting started
This is what you do to start using MESA:
* Download the compiled package from Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/communities/mesatool/
* Run mesa.exe
* Follow the instructions on the screen.

### Pocessing capabilities required
This depends very a lot on the input data to be handled. Generally having a complex geocode with many objects will increase the calculation resource requirements.
