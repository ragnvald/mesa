README for MESA Tool (Python Implementation)

Overview
The MESA (Methods for Environmental Sensitivity Assessment) tool is a Python-based application designed to assess and map environmental sensitivity, particularly in relation to potential pollution incidents in the petroleum industry. It provides a systematic framework for evaluating the vulnerability and sensitivity of environmental assets such as coastal areas, ecosystems, and wildlife to pollution impacts.

This implementation of the MESA tool compiles a collection of Python scripts into a distributable .exe file, featuring a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with Tkinter.
Features

* Environmental Sensitivity Assessment: Systematic evaluation of various environmental assets' vulnerability to pollution.
* Mapping Capability: Visual representation of sensitivity assessments for easier interpretation and decision-making.
* User-Friendly GUI: Developed using Tkinter for easy navigation and usability.
* Compiled Executable: Distributable .exe version for convenient deployment and usage.
* Customizable Framework: Allows adaptation to different environmental contexts and sensitivity parameters.

System Requirements

    The compiled version (when ready) is expected to be compatible with Windows OS/linux and MacOS.
