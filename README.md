#README for MESA Tool (Python Implementation)

##Overview
The MESA (Methods for Environmental Sensitivity Assessment) tool is a Python-based application designed to assess and map environmental sensitivity, particularly in relation to potential pollution incidents in the petroleum industry. It provides a systematic framework for evaluating the vulnerability and sensitivity of environmental assets such as coastal areas, ecosystems, and wildlife to pollution impacts.

This implementation of the MESA tool compiles a collection of Python scripts into a distributable .exe file, featuring a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with Tkinter.
Features

* Environmental Sensitivity Assessment: Systematic evaluation of various environmental assets' vulnerability to pollution.
* Mapping Capability: Visual representation of sensitivity assessments for easier interpretation and decision-making.
* User-Friendly GUI: Developed using Tkinter for easy navigation and usability.
* Compiled Executable: Distributable .exe version for convenient deployment and usage.
* Customizable Framework: Allows adaptation to different environmental contexts and sensitivity parameters.


##Script Descriptions

**01_import.py**
Importing data or modules (specific details not provided).

**03_data_structure.py**
Shared/general functions, possibly for data structure definitions.

**04_edit_asset_group.py**
Shared/general functions for asset group management.

**04_edit_geocode_group.py**
Reading configuration files and managing geocoded data groups.

**04_edit_input.py**
Shared/general functions for input management.

**05_main_statistics.py**
Likely handles main statistical computations (specific details not provided).

**06_process.py**
Main processing logic of the MESA tool (specific details not provided).

**07_edit_atlas.py**
Functions for editing or managing atlas data.

**user_interface.py**
Functions related to checking and creating folders, and user interface aspects.


##System Requirements

This depends very a lot on the input data to be handled. Generally having a complex geocode with many objects will increase the calculation resource requirements.




The compiled version is being prepared. Cross-platform error handling is one big issue pending.
