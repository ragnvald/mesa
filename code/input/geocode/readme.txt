Place geocodes in this folder. Geocodes are unique identifiers assigned to specific geographic locations, typically represented as numerical or alphanumeric codes. They enable precise identification and referencing of locations on the Earth's surface in various data systems and applications. Common uses of geocodes include mapping, navigation, and geographic information systems (GIS) for accurate spatial data representation and analysis.


Geocodes could be:

* Shapefiles 
* Geopackage files with one or more spatial tables

Make sure the qdgc-field is unique. Non-unique codes will be revised.
