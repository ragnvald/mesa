<p>Welcome to the MESA 4.0 tool. The tool is based on a method developed by UNEP-WCMC and the Norwegian Environment Agency.</p>
<p>You are now in the <b>About...</b>-screen. Our aim with this page is to give you some basic information about how to use the system.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h3>Import data</h3>
<p>To work with MESA you will have to provide input data. The data must be placed in the correct folders:
<ul>
  <li>Asset (input/asset)</li>
  <li>Atlas (input/atlas)</li>
  <li>Geocode (input/geocode)</li>
  <li>Lines (input/lines)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Set up processing</h3>
<p>Processing data for a sensitivity atlas involves registering asset values and suceptibilitis. This is done by pressing the <b>Set up</b>-button.
</p>
<h3>Process data data</h3>
<p>This is where you initiate the processing. Processing time will tepend on how many 
assets you have and the granularity of your geocode objects. It could take anything 
a couple of minutes to an hour.</p>
<h3>Work with lines</h3>
<p>If you would like to work with line segments you will need to store appropriate lines 
in the lines-folder. You will have three options in this user interface.
<ul>
  <li>Initiate - creates some random lines for you to work on</li>
  <liEdit segments - here you can edit the width and length of the line segments per line. This means you can have individual lengts and withs.</li>
  <li>Process segments does the same for line segments as the processing does for the geocode objects. Map and analysis layers are created.</li>
  <li>Lines (input/lines)</li>
</ul>
The system can also generate some random lines for you. You can then 
adjust these lines later.
