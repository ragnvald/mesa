<p>Welcome to the MESA 4.0 tool. The tool is based on a method developed by UNEP-WCMC and the Norwegian Environment Agency. 
You are now in the quick guide for our tool. Our aim with this page is to give you some basic information about how to use the system.</p>
<p>
<div><img src="system_resources/system_overview.png" alt="System overview graphic" width=720 halign=center></div> 
</p>
<h3>User interface overview</h3>
<p>The MESA user interface can be divided into two types; imports/processing and data entry/edit. When data is imported or processed 
  you will find that the log window provides information about the progress. 
</p>
<p>
<div><img src="system_resources/processing_logoutput.png" alt="Sample log output" width=600 halign=center></div> 
</p>
<p>Aprogress bare will give you a visual indication of the progress. It however may not always represent an accurate account of the progress.
</p>
<p>When you edit data, move to the next record or close the dialogue, your edits will be automatically saved.
</p>
<h3>Import data</h3>
<p>To work with MESA you will have to provide input data. This is part of building up the database. Eventually your 
  input data will be processed and you will be provided with a database for visualisation or further analysis.</p>
<p>Valid data formats are shapefiles or a geopackage file with tables. The data must be placed in the correct folders:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Data</th>
    <th>Folder</th>
    <th>Comment</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Asset</td>
    <td>input/asset</td>
    <td>Spatial format can be point, lines or polygons</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Geocode</td>
    <td>input/geocode</td>
    <td>Calid format is polygons</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Atlas</td>
    <td>input/atlas</td>
    <td>Valid format is polygons</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lines</td>
    <td>input/lines</td>
    <td>Lines are only valid data format</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>If you import new data after having processed your data you will have to enter the setup data again.</p>
<h3>Set up processing</h3>
<p>Processing data for a sensitivity atlas involves registering asset values and 
  suceptibilitis. This is done by pressing the <b>Set up</b>-button.
</p>
<p>
  <div><img src="system_resources/processing_setup.png" alt="Processing set up" width=700 halign=center></div> 
  </p>
<h3>Process data data</h3>
<p>This is where you initiate the processing. Processing time will depend on how many 
assets you have and the granularity of your geocode objects. It could take anything 
a couple of minutes to an hour.</p>
<h3>Work with lines</h3>
<p>If you would like to work with line segments you will need to store appropriate 
  lines in the lines-folder. You will have three options in this user interface.
<ul>
  <li>Initiate - creates some random lines for you to work on</li>
  <li>Edit segments - here you can edit the width and length of the line segments per 
    line. This means you can have individual lengts and withs.</li>
  <li>Process segments does the same for line segments as the processing does for the 
    geocode objects. Map and analysis layers are created.</li>
  <li>Lines (input/lines)</li>
</ul>
<p>The system can also generate some random lines for you. You can then 
adjust these lines later.</p>
<h3>Making maps</h3>
<p>We have prepared a QGIS project file. The file contains prepared styles and map templates 
  making it straight forward to produce a sensitivity atlas.</p>
<p>Since all MESA-data is stored in a database file other desktop or server tools may be 
  used. It will however require deailed knowledge about the GIS-tool.</p>
  
<h3>Resetting the system</h3>
<p>At any time, if you want to give your project a fresh start, you can do so by deleting 
  the existing database. This is the procedure:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Stop this program by pressing the Exit-button</li>
  <li>Delete the database file. Its name is mesa.gpkg. You will find it in the folder /output</li>
</ol>
<h3>Handling your data</h3>
<p>National regulations might stop you from sending your data abroad for processing. In MESA 3.0 we 
  facilitated for cloud based processing. In this version we are back on processing on the 
  desktop this way you will always have your data with you.</p>
  <p>The system will by default send usage statistics to an online server. On the Registration-page 
  you may turn of this functionality. Statistics are sent when you start up the system. It will 
  only do this once every 24th hour. If you do not have any internet access the statistics will 
  not be sent.</p>
  <h3>An open system for all</h3>
<p>MESA 4.0 is open source code. It uses open source libraries and will not require any paid 
  licenses for use.
</p>
  <p>If you would like to look at the code or even contribute with comments, bug messages or 
    even updates to the code you can do this on GitHub.
