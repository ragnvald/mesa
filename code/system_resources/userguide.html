<p>Welcome to the MESA 4.0 tool. The tool is based on a method developed by UNEP-WCMC and the Norwegian Environment Agency. 
You are now in the quick guide for our tool. Our aim with this page is to give you some basic information about how to use the system.</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Import data</h3>
<p>To work with MESA you will have to provide input data. This is part of building up the database. Eventually your 
  input data will be processed and you will be provided with a database for visualisation or further analysis.</p>
<p>Valid data formats are shapefiles or a geopackage file with tables. The data must be placed in the correct folders:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Data</th>
    <th>Folder</th>
    <th>Comment</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Asset</td>
    <td>input/asset</td>
    <td>Spatial format can be point, lines or polygons</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Geocode</td>
    <td>input/geocode</td>
    <td>Calid format is polygons</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Atlas</td>
    <td>input/atlas</td>
    <td>Valid format is polygons</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lines</td>
    <td>input/lines</td>
    <td>Lines are only valid data format</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>Set up processing</h3>
<p>Processing data for a sensitivity atlas involves registering asset values and suceptibilitis. This is done by pressing the <b>Set up</b>-button.
</p>
<h3>Process data data</h3>
<p>This is where you initiate the processing. Processing time will tepend on how many 
assets you have and the granularity of your geocode objects. It could take anything 
a couple of minutes to an hour.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Work with lines</h3>
<p>If you would like to work with line segments you will need to store appropriate lines 
in the lines-folder. You will have three options in this user interface.
<ul>
  <li>Initiate - creates some random lines for you to work on</li>
  <li>Edit segments - here you can edit the width and length of the line segments per line. This means you can have individual lengts and withs.</li>
  <li>Process segments does the same for line segments as the processing does for the geocode objects. Map and analysis layers are created.</li>
  <li>Lines (input/lines)</li>
</ul>
<p>The system can also generate some random lines for you. You can then 
adjust these lines later.</p>
<h3>Making maps</h3>
<p>We have prepared a QGIS project file. The file contains prepared 
styles and map templates making it dtraight forward to produce a 
sensitivity atlas.</p>
<p>Since all MESA-data is stored in a database file other desktop or 
server tools may be used. It will however require detailed knowledge 
about the GIS-tool.</p>
